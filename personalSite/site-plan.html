      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Whenever students struggle with their homework, or they feel frustrated and trapped in all the busywork, or they don’t have anyone to rely on for help, this site is for that. It’s easy to use and intuitive as there isn’t much to mess up. There are two sub sections, study material and music. Study material is for the students to post textbook pdf’s and uncomplete worksheets so that students can go to them and have easy access to material to study with. Music is for students to post the music they listen to as they study, hopefully, it will mostly consist of calming yet focusing music. The main part is to create forum posts that help other students out with school, and this will be for anyone that speaks English (as my abilities to code a translator is lacking). It will always be available, and I hope that overtime it will grow to be a incredibly vast and reliable source of practice, so that no student is left behind. For the students, by the students. Students will come asking questions, and if everything works, then they will leave knowing not only what they came for, but more.

      </ul>
      <h3>Study Material</h3>
      <p>
        This is where the students will post things like completed tests and blank worksheets so that new and aspiring students can have valuable resources to study from. Has every worksheet you’ve been given helped with the unit test that was coming up? This is for just that, as this will not only give the proper amount of material to learn the basics, but extra practice to get ahead. If the student is diligent then they will be very successful with this site. I would like this to be a give and take relationship, so what I intend is to have a basic level of info be present to all users, and the only way to get to everything is to provide some of your own, so that ensure the growth of the website. With premium access means an account will need to be created, but it would be free and again, no money involved, just providing some material of your own to gain others. Visitors will come for the pure vastness of the site, hundreds or even thousands of worksheets and textbooks, just waiting to be used for good.

      </ul>
      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>
        This is where students will post playlists or albums or just individual songs in either a link to another website or you can upload the song to the site. There would only be a basic selection of songs to the average user, but for those who make an account or login, can post their own music, and then gain access to the full selection. This is to incentivize the growth of the website and to prove you want this. Visitors would come as there would be a large selection of calming music for those who just want to study. This page would be more laid back, and questions about work would be left for the study page. So, any questions about the music could be handled by other users.
