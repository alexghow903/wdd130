            A forum for students in need.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Whenever students struggle with their homework, or they feel frustrated and trapped in all the busywork, or they don’t have anyone to rely on for help, this site is for that. It’s easy to use and intuitive as there isn’t much to mess up. There are two sub sections, study material and music. Study material is for the students to post textbook pdf’s and uncomplete worksheets so that students can go to them and have easy access to material to study with. Music is for students to post the music they listen to as they study, hopefully, it will mostly consist of calming yet focusing music. The main part is to create forum posts that help other students out with school, and this will be for anyone that speaks English (as my abilities to code a translator is lacking). It will always be available, and I hope that overtime it will grow to be a incredibly vast and reliable source of practice, so that no student is left behind. For the students, by the students. Students will come asking questions, and if everything works, then they will leave knowing not only what they came for, but more.
