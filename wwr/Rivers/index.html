                    Floods are frequent to areas of intense water, like white water rivers. This page will let you know what rivers are at what levels of intesity, and if they are currently safe from flooding. Each of our rivers are well maintained and checked with meters to see what stage they are in. If the river is at the action stage or higher its is blocked off for consumer use. We value fun and safety, as you can't enjoy the fun if you get hurt.

                This is a river that has gone wrong. Poor maintenance and lack of care has led to people being in danger, this is what we try to avoid.
